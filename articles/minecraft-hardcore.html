    <h1>Minecraft hardcore</h1>

    <a href="../pages/blog.html" class="go-back-btn">
      Go Back
    </a>

    <p>A week ago, I started my own hardcore world in minecraft. I tried it many times before, however, I always died stupidly, for example, in caves, creeper explosions, drowned zombies with trident and more. But this time i have survived a bit more than that and I am still surviving.</p>

    <p>I was not playing the game for a while but recently, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PewDiePie">pewdiepie</a> playing his own hardcore world and I was inspired to try again. I really really liked his base and watching his journey was fun and interesting. Unfortunately, he is not continueing it anymore :(</p>

    <p>Okay my journey now. These are some screenshots i took while playing but i dont have all of them right now. Will post more about other staff later...</p>

    <p>Yea, for now that is it. I will make more posts...</p>

    <p>I really do not know what kind of mega base i can build. I really liked pewdiepie's inferno vibe but will it now be stealing the others idea?! or just copying it and i dunno playing it not for myself</p>

    <p>i have done this kind of thing all my life!</p>

    <p>for example, when i was kid, my dad had wallet with many pockets. but i wanted my own too even if i did not have any money so i made my own with cardboards. the result was pretty cool. it was similar to his though... but one day, i was angry and just destroyed it for some reason </p>

    <p>my friend at lyceum, had his notebook where he kept his new vocabulary words and sat math formulas or tips or whatever notes related to college application, ielts, sat... i tried similar thing too but it was never effective but the way he kept it was lookin very "?" i dunno how to explain but smart hell knows</p>

    <p>and more these kind of stories and things i have got and do which i hate and i always fckn copy. why i dont have fckn my vibe</p>

    <p>again, stupid whining of me</p>
